If you plan on touching the code, use good convention and commenting. No unreadable code, make sure its easy to interpret. Add your self to the list if u want and update the version(basically the date xx.xx.xxxx) and include a brief summary of changes(in INFO.txt).

Read The info INFO.txt for finer information on website details(not on site design).

/assets contains svg, png, and jpg files for testing or current use. All imagery should go into /assets. Be careful when touching asset files, you may remove things in use, always double check. Be careful with copywrited content since i asum this will be hosted publically. Please use public domain or creative commons content unless u own something. Put extra css and js files in assets, the only ones that should be outside of it are the primary ones.

KEEP THINGS CLEAN!
